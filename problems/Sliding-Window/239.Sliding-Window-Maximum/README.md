# Problem
You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.


### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```


### Solution
What is basically means is that window is fized size at `k`. we will move window forward one each time, during each window we want to find the biggest
value in that window. In example 1, first window is [1, 3, -1], biggest is 3 so we have 3 as the first element in result list
